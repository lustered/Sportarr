/// <summary>
/// Per-league refresh predicate for the 24h auto-sync. Mirrors the
/// pattern Sonarr uses for ShouldRefreshSeries: a tiered ceiling and
/// floor against the last successful sync timestamp so the bulk
/// scheduler walks every league but only burns upstream traffic on
/// the ones that actually need it.
///
/// Order matters:
///   1. Never synced               -> refresh (no baseline)
///   2. Older than ceiling (30d)   -> refresh (force a re-pull)
///   3. Newer than floor (6h)      -> skip (recently synced, don't hammer)
///   4. In between                 -> refresh (normal daily catch-up)
///
/// The 6h floor is the load-shedding lever: a user who restarts a few
/// times in a morning, or two installs whose jittered schedules happen
/// to land close together, won't all re-walk every monitored league
/// against sportarr.net. The 30d ceiling guarantees we eventually
/// pick up any league that's drifted (new alternate names, logo
/// updates, etc.) even when steady-state daily syncs got skipped.
///
/// Manual paths (the refresh button, first-time league add) bypass
/// this predicate by design -- they go straight to
/// SyncLeagueEventsAsync with forceRefresh=true.
