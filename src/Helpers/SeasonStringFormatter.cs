/// Generates future-season strings in the same format the league

/// shape of that identifier varies by sport:
///   - Single-year (e.g. Formula 1, MLB):  "2025"
///   - Two-year span full (e.g. NBA, NHL):  "2025-2026"
///   - Two-year span short (some soccer):   "2024-25"
///   - Slash-separated variants:            "2024/2025", "2024/25"
///
/// LeagueEventSyncService likes to extend the API's season list with
/// a few upcoming years so events that have already been scheduled
/// but not yet folded into /list/seasons still get pulled. The naive
/// "add 2026, 2027, 2028..." approach worked for single-year leagues
/// but produced guaranteed-404 requests for every two-year-span
/// league, which on a per-league per-sync cycle wasted six round
/// trips to sportarr.net plus a slot in the upstream semaphore. This
/// helper inspects the existing seasons, picks the dominant format,
/// and emits future strings that match.
///
/// If we can't recognize any format (empty input, non-year strings),
/// we fall back to the plain 4-digit-year shape -- same as the old
/// blind loop, which is safe for the single-year case and no worse
/// than today's behavior for the unknown case.
