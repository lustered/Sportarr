///
/// 1. The FFmpeg child process crashed silently (segfault, OOM,
///    network drop with no auto-reconnect) - the row stays Recording
///    but no process exists.
/// 2. The whole app crashed mid-recording and restarted - the
///    in-memory _activeRecordings dictionary lost the process handle
///    but the row still says Recording.
/// 3. The source stream is alive but the file isn't growing - frozen
///    upstream that ffmpeg keeps "reading" but produces no output.
///
/// On every tick we walk the DB rows in Recording state, compare them
/// to FFmpegRecorderService's in-memory map and the output file's
/// growth, and either gracefully stop runs that overran or fail-mark
/// runs that have no live writer behind them.
